# todo

- Add condition to level gen. Track bounce walls and teleport when used, so that solution must include them

- find way to compress level into small string
  - x, y, coord of start, coord of finish, coord of all blocks in 2d array (all coords in 2d array, numbers in hex?)
  - Use this for handful of pre-gen and/or sharing/saving
  - Share level via b64 encoded url!

- implement teleporters
  - randomly place teleporters first, ensure they don't share x or y (to prevent infinite loops)
  - could still go infinite with slopes. add counter to applyMove and throw exception if it has moved 10x the level width

- Custom level maker? Letâ€™s you know if solvable
